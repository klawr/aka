Create index.html for url forwarding using a .aka file
.aka files are created by latex documents using

```latex
\usepackage{tocloft}

\newcommand{\listlinkname}{List of Links}
\newlistof{links}{aka}{\listlinkname}
\cftpagenumbersoff{links}
\newcommand{\theaka}{\url{https://aka.klawr.de/project\#\thelinks}}
\newcommand{\aka}[1]{\refstepcounter{links}\theaka%
\addcontentsline{aka}{links}{%
\theaka\dotfill\hbox{}\newline%
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{\dotfill\url{#1}}}}
```

where the project in the `\theaka` command has to be the name of the directory in this repo.
The mappings are generated by calling links with
```latex
\aka{https://github.com/klawr/aka}
```

The index.html in the respective repo has to be updated of course.

The input is assumed to be a list of pairs of aka links and the targets.
All links have to be: `https://` and are marked by the `\url` styling in LaTeX.
The aka links are identified by `https://aka.klawr.de`, so they have to be
handed over this way.
At the moment there is no way to create more than one `index.html` in, so each
project has to have its own directory...
