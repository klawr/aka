# aka.klawr.de

This repository is used to have prettier links in reports and other documents.
Each project gets one `index.html` which is put into a respective directory.

E.g. the directory `srp` handles links from the Student research project and manages links such as:

https://aka.klawr.de/srp#1 which redirects to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research.

Create index.html automatically for using a .aka file.
.aka files are created by LaTeX documents using the following snippet:

```latex
\usepackage{tocloft}

\newcommand{\listlinkname}{List of Links}
\newlistof{links}{aka}{\listlinkname}
\cftpagenumbersoff{links}
\newcommand{\theaka}{\url{https://aka.klawr.de/project\#\thelinks}}
\newcommand{\aka}[1]{\refstepcounter{links}\theaka%
\addcontentsline{aka}{links}{%
\theaka\dotfill\hbox{}\newline%
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{\dotfill\url{#1}}}}
```

where the project in the `\theaka` command has to be the name of the directory in this repo.
The mappings are generated by calling links with
```latex
\aka{https://github.com/klawr/aka}
```

The index.html in the respective project directory has to be updated of course.

Updates are done by feeding the generated **document.aka** into the provided **aka.py**.  
TODO: Add a script using node.js.

The input is assumed to be a list of pairs of aka links and the targets.
All links have to be: `https://` and are marked by the `\url` styling in LaTeX.
The aka links are identified by `https://aka.klawr.de`, so they have to be
handed over this way.
At the moment there is no way to create more than one `index.html` in, so each
project has to have its own directory...
