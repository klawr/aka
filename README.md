# aka.klawr.de

This repository is used to have prettier links in reports and other documents.  
Each project gets one **index.html** which is put into a respective directory.

E.g. the directory `srp` handles links from the Student Research Project and manages links such as:

https://aka.klawr.de/srp#1 which redirects to  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research.

Create **index.html** automatically from an **.aka** file.
**.aka** files are created by LaTeX documents using the following snippet:

```latex
\usepackage{tocloft}

\newcommand{\listlinkname}{Link Index}
\newlistof{links}{aka}{\listlinkname}
\newcommand{\theaka}{\url{https://aka.klawr.de/srp\#\thelinks}}
\newcommand{\aka}[1]{\refstepcounter{links}\theaka%
\addcontentsline{aka}{links}{\url{\#\thelinks}: \tiny{\url{#1}}}}
```

where the projectname **X** in the `\theaka` command has to be the name of the directory in this repository.
The mappings are generated by calling links with
```latex
\aka{...}
```
And the respective list has to be placed by placing:
```latex
\listoflinks
```
in the document.


The **index.html** in the respective project directory has to be updated of course.

Updates are done by feeding the generated **document.aka** into the provided **aka.py**.  
TODO: Add a script using node.js.

The input is assumed to be a list of pairs of aka ids and the target links.
All links have to be marked by the \url styling of LaTeX.
The aka links are identified by r'{\\url\s*{\\(#\d+)}:', so they have to be
handed over this way. (Should be done automatically by the LaTeX snippet).

At the moment there is no way to create more than one index.html, so each
project has to have its own directory...
